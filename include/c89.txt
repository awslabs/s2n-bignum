 * C prototypes for s2n-bignum functions, so you can use them in C programs via
 *
 *  #include "s2n-bignum-c89.h"
 *
 * The functions are listed in alphabetical order with a brief description
 * in comments for each one. For more detailed documentation see the comment
 * banner at the top of the corresponding assembly (.S) file, and
 * for the last word in what properties it satisfies see the spec in the
 * formal proof (the .ml file in the architecture-specific directory).
 *
 * For some functions there are additional variants with names ending in
 * "_alt". These have the same core mathematical functionality as their
 * non-"alt" versions, but can be better suited to some microarchitectures:
 *
 *      - On x86, the "_alt" forms avoid BMI and ADX instruction set
 *        extensions, so will run on any x86_64 machine, even older ones
 *
 *      - On ARM, the "_alt" forms target machines with higher multiplier
 *        throughput, generally offering higher performance there.
